This repo is a collection of short, focused code examples and reverse engineering snippets used in my technical blog posts and while solving CTFs, crackmes, and other infosec-related challenges.

Think of it as a digital scratchpad—organized chaos that might help someone else debug, reverse, or just get unstuck.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- 🔐 **Malware Analysis Helpers**  
  Scripts for automating tasks like string decryption, memory dump processing, IDA scripting, and using tools like Dumpulator.

- 🧾 **x64 Assembly Snippets**  
  Minimal, working MASM examples showing how to interact with the C runtime and Windows API directly from assembly. No fluff, just stack alignment and system calls.

- 🎯 **Challenge Tools**  
  Tiny utilities and RE aids built during binary exploitation, CTF puzzles, or reversing exercises.
